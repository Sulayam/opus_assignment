Before you give me every single node and how they work togther in th workflow. I want you to first understand that there are nodes in opus where in each node has its own functionality. Within each node, theres the input then the logic and then the output. Please look through all of the below and give me a new workflow by using the appropriate nodes in the right places.

These are the main parent nodes- Agent,Review, Execute Workflow, Data.
Under Agent we have some child nodes Opus Agent, Custom Agent, Opus Human Task, Decision Agent, Human Decision Agent, Opus Code, Expert

After review node we have Execute Workflow node
Execute Workflow
Execute another workflow

Only active workflows without Human Reviews, Human Tasks
and Human Decision nodes can be used for Sub-Workflow
Execution.

Input and output values come from the Workflow Input and
Output nodes.

❗️ To make changes to these values, please edit the original
workflow.

Please ensure the workflow you are calling does not lead back
to this workflow (cyclic). Doing so may cause an infinite
running workflow.
